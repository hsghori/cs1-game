      You can practice basic for-loop with this blockly game.<br>
      <cite>The <strong>for</strong> statement provides a looping structure and it has a counter variable.<br>
      This variable needs to be initialized before the loop begins 
      and then the counter will be incremented by constant number(i.e. 1 or 2) at the end of each iteration.

      <cite> An even number is an integer which is "evenly divisible" by two.</cite> <br>
      For example, 0,2,4,6, ... are even numbers. and 1,3,5,7, .. are odd numbers<br>
      <li>Instruction</li> 
      You will be given a positive integer. 
      Make a Blockly game which prints out ONLY even numbers sequentially from 0 up until the number given.<br>
      Let's say that you are given a number = 12 
      You only need to print even numbers from 0 to 12.

      You can practice a <strong>while</strong>-loop and (counter) variable with this blockly game. <br>
      <cite>In most computer programming languages, a <strong>while</strong> loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. 
      The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. (Wikipedia) </cite>
      <br>
      It is possible to express more dynamic logics with this while loop because a while loop has more powerful looping behaviour than for-loops.<br>
      To execute a <strong>while</strong> statement, the logic first evaluates expression or condition.
      The loop keeps continuing until the condition is true.
      However, if the condition is false, the flow skips over the loop body and moves on to the next statement.
      <li>Instruction</li> 
      You will be given a positive integer <strong>N</strong>.

      <cite> Binary is a base 2 number system. <br>
      Base 2 means there are only two digits—1 and 0—which correspond to the on and off states your computer can understand.
      You’re probably familiar with base 10—the decimal system. Decimal makes use of ten digits that range from 0 to 9, 
      and then wraps around to form two-digit numbers, with each digit being worth ten times more than the last (1, 10, 100, etc.).
      Binary is similar, with each digit being worth two times more than the last. <strong>(howtogeek.com)</strong><br>
      <li>Instruction</li> 
      You will be given a positive number between 0 < <strong>P</strong> < 100. 
      Print the binary order from lowest base to highest order. <br>
      For example, the number 13 can be thought of as (13 = 1x10 &#185; + 3x10 &#8304;). 
      Similarly the same number 13 with a different base of 2 can also be thought of as "(13 = 1x2 &#179; + 1x2&#178; + 0x2&#185; + 1x2&#8304;) - or the number 1101 in binary.<br>
      Therefore, it should print like below.<br>
      >>>1 <br>
      >>>0 <br>

      <cite>Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. <br>
      Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", 
      and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz". <strong>(Wikipedia) </strong>

        <ol>For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows: <br>
