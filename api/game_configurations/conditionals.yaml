      So far we've been able to transform input into output in a very linear way. But what if we want to perform
      different tasks based on the value of our input?
      <br>
      You have access to two new blocks that will help you perform these "conditional operations".
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Condition</strong> category contains a <strong>if</strong> block. This block contains two slots - the first
            slot takes a condition block which evaluates to True if the condition is True and False if not. The second slot
            takes any series of blocks. The blocks in the second slot are executed if the condition in the first block is True</li>
        <li>The <strong>Comparison</strong> block allows you to compare two numbers using a series of logical operations (<, >, =, etc)</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Given three input integers output only the positive integers.
    blocks:
      - input
      - output
      - logic_compare
      - math_number
      - condition
      - variable

      The <strong>if</strong> block only allows us to take one path (if a condition is true). But what if we want to take
      one path if a condition is true and another path is the condition is false?
      <br>
      Click on the settings icon in the <strong>if</strong> block to access an <strong>else</strong> block. An <strong>else</strong> block must be attached to
      an <strong>if</strong> block and any code inside of the <strong>else</strong> block will be executed if the condition
      of the <strong>if</strong> block is False.
      <br>
      Given the if and else blocks, return the absolute value of the input value. The absolute value of a number is
      the magnitude of the number without regard to its sign.
    blocks:
      - input
      - output
      - condition
      - variable

      If and else are very powerful, but you may have a whole set of related conditions which each have a unique code path.
      For example, converting a number grade to a letter grade would require you to output a different answer for five different
      possible ranges of values.
      <br>
      Click on the settings icon in the <strong>if</strong> block to access an <strong>else< if/strong> block. An <strong>else if</strong> block must be attached to
      an <strong>if</strong> block or another <strong>else if</strong block and any code inside of the <strong>else if</strong> block will be executed if the condition
      of the preceding attached <strong>if</strong> and <strong>else if</strong blocks are false. Any number of <strong>else if</strong>
      blocks may be attached to an <strong>if</strong> block and an <strong>else</strong> block may be attached to the last
      <strong>else if</strong> block in the sequence. The <strong>else</strong> block will only be executed if all
      <strong>if</strong> and <strong>else if</strong> conditions are false.

      You are a teacher grading a very hard exam. To be nice to your students you have adjusted the grading scale to make
      sure they can still get good grades.
      <ul>
        <li>A score between 80 and 100 is an "A"</li>
        <li>A score between 65 and 80 is a "B"</li>
        <li>A score between 45 and 65 is a "C"</li>
        <li>A score between 25 and 45 is a "D"</li>
        <li>A score between 0 and 25 is an "F"</li>
      </ul>
      If a student is on a boundary they should receive the higher grade (so an 80 is an A, not a B).
      <br>
      Given an input value, output the corresponding grade.

      So far we've worked with very simple conditions. However, we can use "logical operators" to execute if
      statements based on much more complex conditions.
      <br>
      You have access to the <strong>logical operator</strong> that will help you perform these "conditional operations".
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AND</strong> - Given two conditions a and b, a AND b is True if and only if both a and b are true.
          <br>
          For example, if x = 5, y = 6, and z = 7,
          <ul>
            <li>x < y AND y < z would be true</li>
            <li>y > x AND y < z would be false</li>
            <li>y > x AND y > z would be false</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>OR</strong> - Given two conditions a and b, a OR b is True if either a, b, or both a and b are true.
          <br>
          For example, if x = 5, y = 6, and z = 7,
          <ul>
            <li>x < y OR y < z would be true</li>
            <li>y > x OR y < z would be true</li>
            <li>y > x AND y > z would be false</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Given four integers (a, b, c, d)
      <ul>
        <li> if a > b AND c > b is true, print 'Both are true'. If not print 'Both are NOT true'  </ol>
        <li> if a > b OR c > b is true, print 'One is true'. If not print 'Neither is true'  </ol>
      </ul>
