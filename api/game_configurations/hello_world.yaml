      Let's start off with the basics!
      <br>
      This is your code editor. You will be using it to create small programs using a
      system called Blockly. You will combine the blocks in the "workbench" on the left
      in the "workspace" on the right to create programs.
      <br>
      For your first task, use the provided blocks to output "Hello world!". When you think
      you have the correct configuration of blocks, hit the "Run" button to see how your
      program runs.
    blocks:
      - text
      - output

      But we can do so much more than print words onto the screen.
      <br>
      Now you have access to a "number" block and a basic arithmetic block. Use these blocks
      to output the result of
      <br>
      1 + 2
      <br>
      3 * 8
      <br>
      7 - 6
