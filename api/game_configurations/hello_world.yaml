      Let's start off with the basics!
      <br>
      This is your code editor. You will be using it to create small programs using a
      system called Blockly. You will combine the blocks in the "workbench" on the left
      in the "workspace" on the right to create programs.
      <br>
      For your first task, use the provided blocks to output "Hello world!". When you think
      you have the correct configuration of blocks, hit the "Run" button to see how your
      program runs.

      But we can do so much more than print words onto the screen. Computers allow us to do complex math
      quickly and easily.
      <br>
      Yow now have access to three new blocks
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>input</strong> block takes the next value from the input.</li>
        <li>The <strong>number</strong> block gives you access to constant integers</li>
        <li>The <strong>arithmetic</strong> block lets you perform basic arithmetic with two numbers</li>
      </ul>
      Given these blocks, output the sum of the two provided input values.
      <br>
      <strong>Your code will be run on other input values so make sure you use the provided blocks and arithmetic operators
      instead of just outputting the results yourself</strong>
    blocks:
      - math_arithmetic
      - math_number
      - input
      - output

      The input blocks only allow us to access the input one time and in a defined order. But what if you need to
      use an input value more than once or out of order? What if you forget what the inputs represent?
      <br>
      You now have access to a <strong>variable</strong> block which allows you to store specific values as named variables.
      To create a new variable, click the <strong>Create Variable</strong> button in the <strong>Variable</strong> category
      in the workbench.
      <br>
      Now you should have access to blocks to:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Setter</strong> block - Set the variable to a new value</li>
        <li><strong>Getter</strong> block - Gets the value of the variable</li>
      </ul>
      You can create more than one variable by clicking <strong>Create Variable</strong> again. The setter and getter
      blocks will allow you to toggle between variables and rename your variables.
      <br>
      We have provided the input in a specific order. Use the variable blocks to output the input values in reverse.
    blocks:
      - variable
      - input

      Consider a ball rolling along the floor. Physics tells us that we can calculate the distance an object has traveled
      using the equation:
      <br>
      distance = speed * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time ^ 2
      <br>
      You will be provided with the following three input values:
      <ol>
        <li>Time - the time the object spends rolling before it stops.</li>
        <li>Speed - the speed at which the object starts rolling.</li>
        <li>Acceleration - the rate at which the speed is increasing.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      Output the distance an object rolls given the input values.

      Given an <strong>addition</strong> block and some variable blocks, can you
      multiply the input value by 8.
      <br>
      Hint: There is a way to do this in only three additions instead of eight.
