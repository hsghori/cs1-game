      <cite> In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an <strong>array</strong> or <strong>list</strong>, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), 
      each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.(Wikipedia) </cite>

      You can practice basic concept of list<br>
      <cite> In computer science, many data structures (such as list, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary) 
      are abstract data types composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, 
      such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection. (Wikipedia) </cite>
      <br>
      It is very important to understand this concept of (key,value) when you're programming 
      because you need to frequently search values based on the key or index  <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Instruction</li> 
        <ol> In most programming languages, index starts with 0 and continue with 1,2,3, .. and so on. </ol>
        <ol> You will be given a set of integers. Find out the maximum value of integer and return its index. </ol>
        <ol> For example, you are given [41,19,49,17,85]. In this case 85 is the biggest number, so return 4 for its index</ol>
      </ul>

      <cite> In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. <br>
      This algorithm is made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, 
      performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array. 
      Sorting algorithms are often taught early in computer science classes 
      as they provide a straightforward way to introduce other key computer science topics like Big-O notation.(Wikipedia) </cite>
      <br><br>
      However, this game will give you a very basic sense of sorting of numbers 
      when you use a specific block which already implemented with sorting algorithm.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Instruction</li> 
        <ol> Yow will be given a set of 10 integers. Print out only even numbers which are sorted in an ascending order</ol>
        <ol> For example, you are given [14,44,46,97,36,84,22,7,24,88]. print [14,22,24,36,44,46,84,88], There are no odd numbers (97,7) in sorted numbers </ol>
