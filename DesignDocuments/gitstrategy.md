##Git Strategy for Professor CS

1. Code will be developed in feature branches (not the master branch).
2. Merge requests will be opened once a feature is complete. Developers will tag each team member.
3. Rebase and/or squash commits before merging.
4. At least two team members need to approve the merge request for code to be merged.
5. Delete branch after merge.
